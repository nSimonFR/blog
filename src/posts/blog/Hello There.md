## ğŸ‘‹ Welcome to my blog ğŸ‘‹

My name is Nicolas, I'm a software engineer working from Paris ! ğŸ—¼

This is my blog, a place where I share my recipes, my thoughts, and hopefully some other stuff. My recipes will be in French ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·, but the blog will be in English ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§.

The blog is made with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) ğŸš€, based on [Eleventy Duo](https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo) theme, and with custom added support for [Cooklang](https://cooklang.org/), inspired by the article from [Mathew Paul](https://www.mathew-paul.nz/posts/adding-cooklang-to-my-blog/).

You can find my website [here](https://nsimon.fr), and the recipes ["iÃ§i"](/recipes) !
